        <h2>The Brewing Process</h2>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>1. Malt is milled (or cracked) to expose the starches in the barley,
                before being transferred to the Mash Tun.</li>
            <li>2. Milled malt is mixed with hot water, activating enzymes that convert
                starches into fermentable sugars. The liquid this process creates is called
                "sweet wort".</li>
            <li>3. The sweet wort is seperated from the spent grain and transferred to the
                kettle, where it is boiled for around an hour. Hops are added at various times
                in the boil to add bitterness, flavor, and aroma. The product of this boil is called
                "bitter wort".</li>
            <li>4. The bitter wort is transferred into a fermentation tank, where yeast will be added.
                Over the course of two to six weeks, the yeast will consume the sugars in the wort, and produce
                two by-products: alcohol and c02.</li>
            <li>5. The beer is cooled, putting the yeast in suspension(this is called "crashing"). At this point,
                the yeast is pulled from the tank, and can be used for future batches.</li>
            <li>6. The beer is tranferred into a bright tank, where it can be carbinated, and then packaged into
                kegs, bottles, or cans.</li>
            <li>7. Drink that beer.</li>
